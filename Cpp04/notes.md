# CPP Module 04
- Subtype polymorphism
- abstract classes
- interfaces


# Exercise 00: Polymorphism
- Implement a base class `Animal`
- Derived classes:
	- `Dog`
	- `Cat`
	- These must set their type field depending on their name.
		- Dog‚Äôs type will be initialized to `"Dog"`
		- Cat‚Äôs type will be initialized to `"Cat"`
- The type of the Animal class can be left empty or set to the value of your choice.
- Every animal must be able to use the member function:
	- `makeSound()` It will print an appropriate sound
- Implement a `WrongCat` class that inherits from a `WrongAnimal` class. 
	- If you replace the `Animal` and the `Cat` by the wrong ones in the code above, the `WrongCat` should output the `WrongAnimal` sound.
- Implement and turn in more tests than the ones given above.

### Review:
- Object slicing:
	- Assignment of derived class objects to base class objects leads to object slicing, where only the base class part is copied.


# Exercise 01: I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire
- Implement a `Brain` class. 
	- It contains an array of `100` `std::string` called `ideas`
- Update `Dog` and `Cat` to have a private attribute `Brain *` attribute
	- Upon construction, Dog and Cat will create their Brain using `new Brain();`
	- Upon destruction, Dog and Cat will `delete` their Brain.
- In `main`, create and fill an array of `Animal` objects.
	- Half of it will be `Dog` objects and the other half will be `Cat` objects.
	- At the end of your program execution, loop over this array and delete every Animal.
	- You must delete directly dogs and cats as Animals.

### Review:
- Multiple inheritance
	- A derived class can inherit from more than one base class. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class, enabling more complex and flexible designs.



# Exercise 02: Abstract class
üßê ***What is an abstract class?***
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be a base class for other classes.
- Contains at least one pure virtual function, which is declared by assigning = 0 to a virtual function. This makes the class abstract.
- Derived classes must implement all pure virtual functions to be instantiated.

- Fix the `Animal` class so nobody can instantiate it. Everything should work as before.


# Exercise 03: Interface & recap
üßê ***What is an interface?***
-  A pure abstract class that has only pure virtual functions and no data members. 
	- It serves as a contract for derived classes to implement specific behaviors.
- Pure Virtual Function: 
	- Declared by assigning `0` to the virtual function.
	- `virtual void functionName() = 0;`

üßê ***What are concrete classes?***
- Concrete classes are classes that can be instantiated. 
	- They provide implementations for all their member functions, including any virtual functions inherited from base classes.

# Recap:
- **Abstract Class:** 
	- A class that cannot be instantiated directly. It may contain both pure virtual functions and other member functions or data members.

- **Interface (Pure Abstract Class):** 
	- A special type of abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions and no data members. It serves as a contract for derived classes.

- **Concrete Class:** 
	- Can be instantiated. Provides implementations for all its member functions.

üßê ***What is a deep copy?***
- A deep copy means that when a copy of an object is created, it should also create copies of the objects that it points to, ensuring that any changes to the copied object does not affect the original object.
- This is achieved by implementing a copy constructor and assignment operator that perform a deep copy.
