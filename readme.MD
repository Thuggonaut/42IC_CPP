# ¬©Ô∏è ‚ûï‚ûï Modules

# Introduction:
- C++ or "C, with Classes" is an extension of C.
- CPP aims to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming, OOP. 


# General rules:
- Must comply with `C++ 98 standard`.
- Compile with `g++` and the flags `-std=c++98 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Write `class names in UpperCamelCase` format.
	- Files containing class code will always be named according to the class name.
	- For instance: `ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h`, `ClassName.cpp`, or `ClassName.tpp`. 
	- For instance, if a class is named BrickWall, the corresponding files should be named BrickWall.hpp, BrickWall.cpp, or BrickWall.tpp.
- Unless specified, every `output message must be ended by a \n` and `displayed to the console`.
- Goodbye Norminette!
- **PERMITTED:**
	- The standard library.
	- `STL` (Standard Template Library) in the Module 08 and 09 only.
- **FORBIDDEN:**
	- External libraries: `C++11` (and derived), `Boost`.
	- Functions: `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()`.
	- Unless specified, `using namespace` `<ns_name>` and `friend` keywords.
	- (Except Module 08 and 09) `Containers` (`vector/list/map/`and so forth) and `Algorithms` (anything requiring the `<algorithm>` header).
	- Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates). Example function template:
```c++
template <typename T> //Generic function that can operate on various data types. `T` for type
void swap(T &a, T &b) {
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```
- No memory leaks.
- Unless specified, your classes must be designed in the `Orthodox Canonical Form` OCF:
	- `Private data members`:
	The class's internal state is hidden from the outside world. Can only manipulate it through the class's public member functions.
	- `Public member functions`:
	The class has at least one public member function for each operation that the class is supposed to perform. These functions has descriptive names that indicate what they do.
	- `Getter and Setter Methods`: 
	Access to private member variables are provided through getter and setter methods rather than making the variables public.
	- `Constructors and destructors`:
	The class has a constructor that initializes its private data members, and a destructor that cleans up any resources the class is using.
	- `Copy constructor and copy assignment operator`: 
	The class has a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator that make deep copies of the class's private data members. When a new object NO is created from an existing object EO, or when an EO is assigned a new value, the NO has its own copy of the data members.
	- `Assignment operator`: 
	The class has an assignment operator that makes a deep copy of the right-hand operand and assigns it to the left-hand operand. When an EO is assigned a new value, the left-hand operand has its own copy of the data members.
	- `Equality and inequality operators`:
	The class has equality and inequality operators that compare the values of the private data members of two objects, and return true or false.
	- `Input and output operators`:
	The class has input and output operators that read and write the values of the private data members to and from an input stream and an output stream.
- You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others.


| üî∏ **Library** | Header | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input/Output Streams | `<iostream>` | For Input/output operations <br>Provides standard input/output streams |
| File I/O | `<fstream>` | File stream operations for reading from and writing to files |
| String Streams | `<sstream>` | Used to manipulate strings as if they were input/output streams |
| Character handling | `<cctype>` | Functions for testing and manipulating individual characters e.g. `isalpha`, `toupper` etc. |
| Error Handling | `<stdexcept>` | Standard exceptions and error handling |
| Manipulators | `<iomanip>` | Input/output manipulators for controlling formatting |
| | `<string>` |  |
| Numerics | `<cmath>` | Mathematical functions like `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, etc |
| Utility | `<random>` | Random number generation utilities |
| Time and Date | `<ctime>` | Date and time functions |
|  | `<chrono>` | Time utilities for measuring time intervals and durations |
| C Standard Library Headers | `<cstdio>` | |
|  | `<cstdlib>  `|  |
| **Forbidden (STL)** | | |
| Iterators | `<iterator>` | Classes and functions for working with iterators. <br>Provides a access to elements in a sequence |
| Memory Management | `<memory>` | Utilities for compile-time type introspection |
| Regular Expressions | `<regex>` | Regular expression support |
| Functional | `<functional>` | Function objects and utilities for working with functions |
| Utilities | `<utility>`| Miscellaneous utility components such as `std::pair`, `std::move`, etc |


***NOTE: When using elements or calling functions from the C++ Standard Library, we need to prefix it with a `std::`***

| üî∏ **Object** | Library | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `std::cout` | `<iostream>` | Output text to the standard output/console <br>`<<` to write to, e.g.: <br>`std::cout << "Hello, World!";` |
| `std::cin` | `<iostream>` | Read input from the standard input/keyboard <br>`>>` to read data from, e.g.: <br>`std::cin >> variable;` |
| `std::cerr` | `<iostream>` | Output an error message. Unlike `cout`, `cerr` is unbuffered and immediately displayed |
| `std::endl` | `<iostream>` | Insert a newline character `\n` to the output stream then flush the stream/output buffer |
| `std::stringstream` | `<sstream>` | Implements an in-memory stream (a stream that operates on strings in memory) allowing you to read from or write to strings using the same interface as the standard input/output streams (`std::cin` and `std::cout`) |



| üî∏ **Class** | Library | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |


| üî∏ **Function** | Library | Syntax | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is_open()` | `<fstream>` |  | Checks whether a file stream is currently associated with a file. It returns a boolean value |
| `rdbuf()` | `<fstream>` |  | Used to access the associated stream buffer object of the stream and returns a `std::streambuf *pointer` |
| `str()` | `<sstream>` |  | Extracts the content of the `stringstream` and returns it as a `std::string` |
| `find()` | `<string>` | `size_t find(const std::string& str, size_t pos = 0) const;` | Used to search for a substring within a string and returns the position of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns `std::string::npos`. `npos` signifies "not found" |
| `substr()` | `<string>` | `std::string substr(size_t pos = 0, size_t len = npos) const;` | Returns a substring of the string object it is called on. Specified by the starting position and the length of the substring to extract. `npos` means "up to the end of the string" |





TODO
- const
- class vs struct
- accessors ?
- pointers to members ?
- comparisons ?
- non member attributes/functions
