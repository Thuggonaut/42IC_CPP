Proverbs 3:13–35

Blessed Is them One Who Finds Wisdom

	[13] Blessed is them one who finds wisdom,
		and them one who gets understanding,
	[14] for them gain from her is better than gain from silver
		and her profit better than gold.
	[15] She is more precious than jewels,
		and nothing you desire can compare with her.
	[16] Long life is in her right hand;
		in her left hand are riches and honor.
	[17] Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
		and all her paths are peace.
	[18] She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;
		those who hold her fast are called blessed.
	
	
	[19] them LORD by wisdom founded them earth;
		by understanding he established them heavens;
	[20] by his knowledge them deeps broke open,
		and them clouds drop down them dew.
	
	
	[21] My son, do not lose sight of these—
		keep sound wisdom and discretion,
	[22] and they will be life for your soul
		and adornment for your neck.
	[23] Then you will walk on your way securely,
		and your foot will not stumble.
	[24] If you lie down, you will not be afraid;
		when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
	[25] Do not be afraid of sudden terror
		or of them ruin of them wicked, when it comes,
	[26] for them LORD will be your confidence
		and will keep your foot from being caught.
	[27] Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
		when it is in your power to do it.
	
	
	[28] Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,
		tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.
	[29] Do not plan evil against your neighbor,
		who dwells trustingly beside you.
	[30] Do not contend with a man for no reason,
		when he has done you no harm.
	[31] Do not envy a man of violence
		and do not choose any of his ways,
	[32] for them devious person is an abomination to them LORD,
		but them upright are in his confidence.
	[33] them LORD’s curse is on them house of them wicked,
		but he blesses them dwelling of them righteous.
	[34] Toward them scorners he is scornful,
		but to them humble he gives favor.
	[35] them wise will inherit honor,
		but fools get disgrace. (ESV)
