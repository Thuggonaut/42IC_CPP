# Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

### Review:
- When `ClapTrack` attacks, it causes its target to lose `<attack damage>` hit points.
- When `ClapTrap` repairs itself, it gets `<amount>` hit points back. 
	- Attacking and repairing cost `1 energy point` each. 
	- Of course, `ClapTrap` can‚Äôt do anything if it has no hit points or energy points left.

- In all of these member functions, you have to print a message to describe what happens. 
	- For example, the `attack()` function may display something like:
	`ClapTrap <name> attacks <target>, causing <damage> points of damage!`
- The constructors and destructor must also display a message, so your peer-evaluators can easily see they have been called.
- Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure your code works as expected.
